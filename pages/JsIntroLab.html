  <h3>Assignments</h3>
  <pre>
1. Define a function max() that takes two numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them. Use the if-then-else construct available in Javascript.
2. Define a function maxOfThree() that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.
3. Write a function isVowel() that takes a character (i.e. a string of length 1) and returns true if it is a vowel, false otherwise.
4. Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. 
    For example, sum([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiply([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.
5. Define a function reverse() that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverse("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".
6. Write a function findLongestWord() that takes an array of words and returns the length of the longest one.
7. Write a function filterLongWords() that takes an array of words and an integer i and returns the array of words that are longer than i.
8.Modify the jsfiddle on the map/filter/reduce slide ( https://jsfiddle.net/keithlevi/e6kqvx2f/9/ ) as follows:

  a) multiply each element by 10; 

  b) return array with all elements equal to 3; 

  c) return the product of all elements;

â€‹After you finish, make sure all your functions are in ONE JS file .
