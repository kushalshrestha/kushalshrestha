    <pre>
Re-implement the following exercises from the W1D5 homework to use map/filter/reduce Array methods instead of for loops.  
Then use Mocha and Chai to create a webpage that tests their functionality and upload this page (along with your code) to your github.io homepage.

4. Define a function sum() and a function multiply() that sums and multiplies (respectively) all the numbers in an array of numbers. 
    For example, sum([1,2,3,4]) should return 10, and multiply([1,2,3,4]) should return 24.
5. Define a function reverse() that computes the reversal of a string. For example, reverse("jag testar") should return the string "ratset gaj".
7. Write a function filterLongWords() that takes an array of words and an integer i and returns the array of words that are longer than i.
