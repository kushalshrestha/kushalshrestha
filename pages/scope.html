        2. ANSWER:
        <strong>
            Global Scope : 
            * Global scope is the scope that contains all of the things defined outside of all code blocks. A global variable has a global scope and whenever an undeclared variable is assigned
            with a value, the variable is also a part of global scope. Any variables assigned without an explicit scope (using the var, let, or const keywords) automatically become global variables. The same is true for functions.

            Local Scope: It contains things defined inside a code blocks.
            * Local variables cannot be accessed or modified outside the function declaration.
        </strong>
        3. 
        (a) Do statements in Scope A have access to variables defined in Scope B and C?
        A: No. Scope A cannot access to local scope.
        (b) Do statements in Scope B have access to variables defined in Scope A?
        A: Yes. Local Scope can access Global scope.
        (c) Do statements in Scope B have access to variables defined in Scope C?
        A: No. Scope B cannot access to child Scope C
        (d) Do statements in Scope C have access to variables defined in Scope A?
        A: Yes. Local Scope can access Global Scope
        (e) Do statements in Scope C have access to variables defined in Scope B?
        A: Yes. Scope C can access outer Scope B.

        4. /* Question 4*/
        var x = 9;
        function myFunction() {
          return x * x;
        }
        
        console.log(myFunction()); // OUTPUT: 81
        x = 5;
        console.log(myFunction()); //OUTPUT: 25

        5. /* Question 5 */
        var foo = 1;
        function bar() {
          if (!foo) {
            var foo = 10;
          }
          console.log(foo); //OUTPUT 10
        }
        bar();
